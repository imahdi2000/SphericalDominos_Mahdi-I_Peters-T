#Chain Reaction

Instructions:

	1. Click anywhere on the map and watch a chain reaction happen.

What to Expect:

     The balls will freely move around the box. However, once the mouse is clicked, an exploding ball will be activated. Once another ball encounters the exploding ball, it too will also explode.

Bugs:

	Some balls may explode near another exploding ball even if there is no direct contact.
